# water-mapping
The aim of this project is to aid researchers, environmentalists and industries to gather information on local water bodies.​

The solution is a compact device that can be used to map out a water body's floor, in the form of a depth map. The distance is calculated from the surface of the water to the floor via ultrasonic signals. It provides easy operation for the user – just start the program and move the bobber across the water. The GPS module will take care of tracking the location for the final mapping.​
